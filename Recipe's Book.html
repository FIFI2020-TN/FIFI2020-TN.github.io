        <p> <em>Brownies</em> are a form of sheet cake. They are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with ice cream, topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North America they are common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses.<br>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33-cm) dark metal pan with softened butter, then line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides. Grease the parchment with softened butter.</p><br>
       <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Combine the chopped chocolate, ¼ cup (30 g) of cocoa powder, and espresso powder in a heatproof liquid measuring cup or medium bowl and set aside.</p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Add the butter to a small saucepan over medium heat and cook until the butter just comes to a vigorous simmer, about 5 minutes, swirling the pan occasionally. Immediately pour the hot butter over the chocolate mixture and let sit for 2 minutes. Whisk until the chocolate is completely smooth and melted, then set aside. </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, salt, and eggs in a large bowl. Beat with an electric hand mixer on high speed until light and fluffy, about 10 minutes. It will be similar to the texture of very thick pancake batter. </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> With the mixer on, pour in the slightly cooled chocolate and butter mixture and blend until smooth.
</p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 6:</strong>Position a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350°F (180°C). </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 7:</strong>Sift in the flour and remaining cocoa powder and use a rubber spatula to gently fold until just combined. </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 8:</strong>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake until lightly puffed on top, about 20 minutes. </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 9:</strong>Remove the baking pan from the oven using oven mitts or kitchen towels, then lightly drop the pan on a flat surface 1-2 times until the brownies deflate slightly. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt. </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 10:</strong>Return the pan to the oven and bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center of the brownies comes out fudgy but the edges look cooked through, about 20 minutes more. The center of the brownies will seem under-baked, but the brownies will continue to set as they cool. </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 11:</strong>Set the brownies on a cooling rack and cool completely in the pan. </p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Use the parchment paper to lift the cooled brownies out of the pan. Cut into 24 bars and serve immediately.</p> <br>
       <p><strong>Step 13:</strong> <em>Enjoy ! </em>
       
        <h4 id="rc2"> <em> Butter Cookies </em> </h4>
        
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Butter_cookies.jpg/250px-Butter_cookies.jpg" alt="gold crispy cookies">
        
         <p><em>Butter cookies</em> are often categorized as a "crisp cookie" due to their texture, caused in part because of the quantity of butter and sugar. It is generally necessary to chill the dough to enable proper manipulation and handling. They also come in a variety of shapes such as circles, squares, ovals, rings, and pretzel-like forms, and with a variety of appearances, including marbled, checkered or plain. Using piping bags, twisted shapes can be made.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Unwrap the puff pastry. Using your hands or a rolling pin, flatten out the seams if your puff pastry has then, making an even rectangle. Brush melted butter evenly over the puff pastry. Sprinkle half of the sugar on the pastry, then spread it around evenly. Using a rolling pin, roll the pastry into a tall rectangle, pressing the sugar into the pastry. Flip the pastry, then repeat the process, brushing with butter and rolling in the rest of the sugar.
</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tightly roll the bottom of the pastry toward the middle, stopping at the center, then roll the top of the pastry to meet in the centre as well. The rolls should be the same size. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill for about 30 minutes.
</p>
     <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
</p>
     <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove the plastic wrap and push one of the rolls directly on top of the other. Trim off the uneven ends of the pastry, then slice into ½-inch (1 cm) rounds. They should look like smushed hearts. Place the slices on the baking sheet about 2 inches (5 cm) apart to allow for expansion. Bake for 15 minutes, flipping them halfway, until the sugar is caramelized and the cookies are golden brown.
